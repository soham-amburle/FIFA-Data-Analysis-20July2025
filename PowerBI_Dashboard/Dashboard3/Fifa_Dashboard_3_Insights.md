# FIFA Dashboard III – Financial Insights: Wage, Value and ROI by Football Club

**Date:** 4 August 2025  
**Tools Used:** Power BI, Power Query, DAX, FIFA Player Dataset

## Project Overview

This dashboard was built to explore how football clubs manage their financial resources, particularly when it comes to player wages, squad value, and return on investment (ROI). It looks at how clubs spend, how much value they get in return, and which clubs are the most efficient in turning financial investment into on-field performance.

## Key Insights

### 1. Spending big doesn’t always mean performing better

Some of the biggest clubs in world football, like Real Madrid, FC Barcelona and Manchester United, rank among the highest in terms of wage spend per player. But when it comes to ROI, they are outperformed by several mid- and lower-tier clubs. This suggests that financial muscle alone doesn't guarantee efficiency or value.

### 2. High ROI clubs tend to fly under the radar

Clubs such as US Orléans, GIF Sundsvall and Seongnam FC deliver some of the highest ROI scores in the dataset. These clubs don’t spend as much as the global giants, but they consistently deliver strong performance metrics relative to their investment. Their ability to do more with less is a clear standout.

### 3. Wage spend and player quality don’t always go hand in hand

A comparison of total wage spend against average player rating shows that high spenders don’t always have the highest-rated players. In fact, many clubs with mid-level wage budgets manage to field high-quality squads. This further highlights the importance of smart recruitment and development strategies.

### 4. Squad size doesn’t strongly correlate with ROI

Clubs with larger squads aren’t necessarily more efficient. For example, while Atlético Nacional and Bayer 04 Leverkusen have high player counts, their ROI doesn't top the list. It’s not about how many players a club has, but how well they’re used.

### 5. Overall financial snapshot from the dataset

- Total squad market value: €4.54 billion

## Narrative Summary

This dashboard demonstrates that financial efficiency in football isn’t just about how much a club can spend—it’s about how wisely that money is used. Clubs that spend less but recruit well, develop talent, and optimise their squad structures often outperform bigger clubs in terms of value delivered per euro spent.
