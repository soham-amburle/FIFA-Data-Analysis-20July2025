- Displays top 5 earners, tallest and heaviest players by nationality (e.g., Germany)
- Ranks players by shooting and defending skills
- Analyzes Real Madrid players by wage, skills, and nationality
- Uses Matplotlib for bar charts and NumPy for filtering

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (imported but not yet used)

## 📌 How to Run

1. Make sure `fifa data.csv` is in the same folder as `fifa.py`.
2. Run the script using:
