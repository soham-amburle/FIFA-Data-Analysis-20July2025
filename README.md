# FIFA Player Data Analysis with Python

This project explores player statistics from a FIFA dataset using Python. It focuses on identifying patterns related to player nationalities, wages, and core skills like shooting and defending. It also takes a closer look at individual clubs such as Real Madrid.

Using Python, the analysis was conducted through data cleaning, filtering, and visualization techniques to uncover insights across different metrics.

## Files Included are

- `Fifa_EDA.py` – The main Python script that is used for the analysis.
- `README.md`
- `PowerBI Dashboard folder`
- `fifa data.csv` – The dataset (not uploaded here due to size and privacy concerns).

## Key Features of the Script

- Loads and processes the dataset using Pandas
- Counts players by nationality
- Visualizes the top 10 nationalities based on player count
- Filters high-earning players with wages over €400,000
- Displays the top 5 earners in the dataset
- Identifies the tallest and heaviest players by nationality (e.g., Germany)
- Ranks players by shooting and defending attributes
- Analyzes Real Madrid players based on wages, skills, and nationality
- Uses Matplotlib for bar charts and NumPy for efficient data filtering
- Seaborn is imported for future visualization improvements

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (imported but not currently used)
